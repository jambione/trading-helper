# After the close — 2026-10-01

The intraday desk's working list for after today's close. Jonathan observes the
session and adds items; Claude keeps this file current and adds whatever the
day's checks turn up. Newest items at the bottom of each section.

## Jonathan's observations

_(none yet)_

## From today's checks (Claude)

- [ ] Engine FLY fix (681c933) first live day: compare logged %R with IEX-rebuilt %R at every fill (`pctr_check.py` in the scratchpad / `/tmp/pctr_check.py` on the mini).
- [ ] Overnight: first scored night (~09:50), first -1% filtered buy (15:58), every kept name filled.

## Built today, deploy after the close

- [ ] Item 4 — engine slow %R measured over 112 *minutes*, not 112 rows (thin IEX names reached back further than TradingView: FLY -40 vs -71). Trading-logic change.

## Context

- 9/30 replay: 55 opens, -1.4 bp/trade gross; costs ~10 bp a trade on top (spread).
- Every entry/exit/filter variant tested since August scores ~0 gross (see memory: exits-cannot-move-the-mean, entry-setups-are-noise-equivalent, the-universe-fades-at-every-horizon). Ideas worth trying are ones that change *which names* or *what information* the desk uses, not another threshold.
